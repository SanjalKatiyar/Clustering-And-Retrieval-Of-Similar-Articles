# Clustering-and-Retrieval
When exploring a large set of documents such as Wikipedia, news articles etc it can be useful to get a list of related material.  To find relevant documents we cluster similar kind of documents together and retrieve the documents that are most related to the given document( or to the document a user is currently reading in case of news article etc).
