# Clustering-and-Retrieval
(This mini-project is a part of <a href=https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning>ML specialization</a> course, dataset or any pre-trained weights/models used were provided by Coursera.)<br/>
When exploring a large set of documents such as Wikipedia, news articles etc it can be useful to get a list of related material.  To find relevant documents we cluster similar kind of documents together and retrieve the documents that are most related to the given document( or to the document a user is currently reading in case of news article etc).Different Models used to accomplish this task are EM Algorithm For A Gaussian Mixture Model, K-Means++ and Locality Sensitive Hashing.
